# PROGRESS
2026-11-13 | Phase 4 import prototype
- Confirmed prior offline PMTiles renderer CI 43359838414 PASS.
- Added `PmtilesHeader`: defensive PMTiles v3 preflight for MVT, ranges, zooms, coordinates and compression flags.
- Added `LocalPackStore`: streaming copy, optional expected SHA-256, app-private staging, atomic per-file promotion, .properties index, listing, re-hash and delete.
- Added JUnit tests for valid import, corruption, oversize, wrong hash and unsafe IDs.
- Added Android SAF document picker and menu for import, display, validation and deletion.
- Added DEBUG-only fixture import for emulator, runs while airplane mode enabled.
- GitHub build / testDebugUnitTest PASS for Phase 4 source.
- CI 43361851396: metadata and archive exist on emulator but smoke falsely failed due to empty tag-filtered logcat output; revised smoke to read and hash actual app-private archive.
- Latest byte-level smoke CI 43362607683: pending result.
- All changes on develop branch, no main merge.
